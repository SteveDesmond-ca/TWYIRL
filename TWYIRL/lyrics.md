# The Upsides

## My Last Semester
Matt says I don't fit in
Matt says, "college hit those dudes like a ton of bricks"

## Logan Circle
They turned on the fountain today at Logan Circle
The Blue Man Group won't cure depression
Drowning my sorrows in Lucky Charms and soy milk

## Everything I Own Fits In This Backpack
I'm not fond of South Philly, or how my neighbors love ICP
I guess it's better than Bancroft Street
Left And Leaving through a blown car stereo
Ready To Die through my headphones
Lonelier Than God next to You Get So Alone Sometimes

## Dynamite Shovel
Rest stop in Tennessee, found where the ignorant fucks of the world meet for donuts and coffee
Rhetoric I thought was reserved for Westboro Baptist and lunatics like that

## New Years With Carl Weathers
It's New Year's Eve and four degrees
Drew's too busy sexting
The soft effects of a Nyquil overdose
The staff of Steak 'n Shake
Hey man, I'll see you in Cleveland

## It's Never Sunny In South Philadelphia
The way that some people love Morrissey

## Hostels & Brothels
The lights of Birmingham are wet and blur in front of me
Last night in Leeds
Ad and I found ourselves wandering the city
The boys are drowning in Strongbow
Weeble's just got caught stealing a Christmas tree
Drove all the way to Glasgow just watch our defeat
Joe was talking to some bar maid, trying to get lucky
I think it almost worked until he ran into Bobby
Unless Great Britain comes to me and says, "it's not so bad if you don't look at it that way"
A shelf in the basement of Liv's house
I thought we'd lost Josh and Mikey

## This Party Sucks
Lycra pants and designer jeans
The north Jersey club scene with the Girls Gone Wild B-Team
Rupert Holmes wrote a song about it in the '70s
Consequently, he also saved the pi√±a colada industry

## Hey, Thanks
The night we went to Atlantic City

## Washington Square Park
I stood on the roof with Matt and Molly
We rode our bikes over to 6th Street
To Washington Square Park, to see if the tides would turn for me
I left a lot of blood in California

## All My Friends Are In Bar Bands
Jack says he loves the winter here
Josh says it smells like cheap beer and loathing here
Max dropped out of college
He and Kevin got matching tattoos
Like-minded dudes in Detroit, or Vancouver, Newport, Boca and Brum
Justin's working three jobs
Spiro lied about his major
Nick and Richie got a place together by the train station
I don't think that we'll ever see Dave again

## I Was Scared And I'm Sorry
In an Outback Steakhouse bathroom, while my family ordered for me
I just can't blame New York for this
The house on Manton Street
She watches Breakfast At Tiffany's
I guess Sarah Marshall does the same for me

## A New Hope
I rode down 19th to Logan Circle
But Arrested Development might if we let it
We're 533 on Manton

## We Won't Bury You
Outside a Waffle House
Your Get Up Kids tattoos

# Suburbia, I've Given You All, And Now I'm Nothing

## Came Out Swinging
We're this generation's Morgan Spurlock
From a South Philly basement, caked in stale beer and sweat

## Woke Up Older
I stacked a Bukowski novel on a Blacklisted LP
Hey Jess, I woke up older carrying two years in the bags under my eyes
Hey Jess, I watched you wake up and get dressed
Avoiding Rittenhouse like the plague
When John introduced "Woke Up New" in St. Augustine

## Suburbia
The guy that played Leatherface in all of those Chainsaw Massacres
Every business on Main Street collapsed
Except Morgan's mom's place

## Summers In PA
Heading up 309
Spiro lied about his major
The casino seemed like a bad idea, but Denny's seemed like a worse one
Busted, broken, choking down a Grand Slam
This generation's Outsiders

## I Won't Say The Lord's Prayer
The church on Main Street
The church on Broad Street

## Coffee Eyes
January 17th, 2006
Patty knew my drink
The time we found Dave half dead in the parking lot
Late at night on Thanksgiving
The fall that Colleen left
I watched Mike slash Mon's tires

## I've Given You All
He was a Vietnam Vet
In Memorial Park, under one of the benches
Starter jackets for teams that haven't existed since the '90s

## Don't Let Me Cave In
A Logan Square basement show with Evan
Chicago looked desperate
Watching the Sears Tower collapse
I tried to make a life in the Midwest

## You Made Me Want To Be A Saint
Dave said "us" like the last three years had never happened
George walked down and threw dirt onto the casket
Slowing down in the August air
The bass drum beat after I'll Catch You
You never got me down, Ray, I never went down

## Hoodie Weather
I've been frequenting a diner on Main Street
Just a hint of a South Philly accent
California on their lips
Rocky's in the Deep South

## And Now I'm Nothing
I keep ending up in Memorial Park
Every year someone steals baby Jesus and nobody stops them, it's a nice tradition
Writing songs on Molly's guitar
The basement room at Richie's house
The Allen Ginsberg of this generation

## My Life As Rob Gordon
Kelly says that
Quoting lyrics from that Movielife song
That one about a crackhead in Janie's Got a Gun
When I mentioned him in Bar Bands
We named a kid we never had after Hannah Hold On
I heard Quentin belt the notes
Some words that Alex wrote about dying alone

## Me vs The Highway
The graffiti over 309
I'll always love you, Katie
Bernard Herman lives

## Living Room Song
Budget Stephen Hawking
The Bible says the world is ending
It goes down around May 20th
Some movie that I swore Keanu Reeves was in
If the Mayans don't believe it, why should I be any different?
My New Found Glory hoodie

# The Greatest Generation

## We Could Die Like This
The whole world smells like True Blue
The faintest hint of Coppertone
The '92 Birds take the field without Jerome Brown

## The Bastards, The Vultures, The Wolves
Jake says I got good intentions

## The Devil In My Bloodstream
The Midwest feels like a hollow place
Staring at the frozen ground, in Goodwill suits
From the heart of North Missouri

## An American Religion
Still living in Richie's basement
Still sitting at the coffee shop with Ken

## Madelyn
It must get lonely by your Chesapeake
You and I got this East Coast blood between us

# No Closer To Heaven

## A Song For Patsy Cline
Patsy Cline came and sang to me

## I Don't Like Who I Was Then
A night at Shore Memorial
Mid-South in the '80s

## Cigarettes & Saints
A candle in every cathedral across Europe

## The Bluest Things On Earth
The bluest things on Earth

## A Song for Ernest Hemingway
We're lost Canadian geese
Staring at Hemingway's shotgun
Christmas in the Congo

## Thanks For The Ride
Just off of Long Beach

## Stained Glass Ceilings
John Wayne with a God complex
Not knowing, growing up, what it's like to belong here, in America
Fucking John Wayne's fucking God complex

## I Wanted So Badly to Be Brave
Barefoot down White's Road

## You In January
We stare at Catalina
A taxi cab in Chelsea
Out past Salvation Mountain
A walk along the High Line
Wicker Park in August
Your Upper East Side dorm room
The South West Marin Headlands

## Palm Reader
A rainy night in California

## No Closer To Heaven
Me and Hemingway share forehead scars

## Slow Dancing With San Andreas
Slow dancing with San Andreas
These snow drifts haunt the Dakotas

# Sister Cities

## Raining in Kyoto
Raining in Kyoto

## It Must Get Lonely
Where the sky meets the Irish sea
A bag of clementines split right open on an English street
In the Montmartre in Paris
Along the fence on Palmer Street

## Sister Cities
The Andes hold me close

## Flowers Where Your Face Should Be
From the Poas peak
Just like the ones that we grew back in Jersey
Our apartment on 2nd Street
Sleeping bags under the 101
Driftwood from Crescent City

## We Looked Like Lightning
It's almost Christmas

## The Ghosts Of Right Now
Where the South Sister should be

## When the Blue Finally Came
In the ocean, south of Sydney off, the interstate

## The Orange Grove
West Texas is dying slow
